# ARI-S
*ARI-S* (pronounced "ari-us") is a real-time engine developed in OpenGL that employs an entity component system to render various scenes. This project was originally intended as means for learning and showcasing advanced rendering techniques, but the scope has expanded to include an interactive editor to dynamically create and load scenes.
